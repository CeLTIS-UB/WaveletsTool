# WaveletsTool
This is the software instrument presented in the article 
"A Method for Tree Detection Based on Similarity with Geometric Shapes of 3D Geospatial Data", available online at   <a>https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/5/298</a> 

The paper presents an approach for detecting patterns in a three-dimensional context. 
The core of the associated algorithm is represented by the cosine similarity computed 
to elevation sub-matrices of regularly gridded digital elevation models. 
The software instrument is compatible with a GIS environment
and allows as inputs locations in the elevation model, based on field data, pre-defined geometric shapes or their combination. 

The software tool is developed in two variants, one in Esri's ArcGIS Platform and the other using only Opensource libraries. 

The instrument development and the steps required for installing the tool are described in the file "Description_Software_Development_Wavelet_Tool.docx"
